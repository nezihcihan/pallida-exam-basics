###  What is the difference between a function and a method? [2p]
#### Your answer:
A method is on an object.
A function is independent of an object. For Java, there are only methods.

A function is a piece of code that is called by name. 
It can be passed data to operate on and can optionally return value. 
All data that is passed to a function is explicitly passed.

A method is a piece of code that is called by a name that is associated with an object. 
In most respects it is identical to a function except for two key differences:

A method is implicitly passed the object on which it was called.
A method is able to operate on data that is contained within the class 


### What is the constructor? When it is used? [2p]
#### Your answer:

Constructor in java is a special type of method that is used to initialize the object.
it is invoked at the time of object creation. 
It constructs the values and provides data for the object.
it's name must be same as its class name and it must have no explicit return type.
